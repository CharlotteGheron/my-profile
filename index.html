				<p>I am passionate about photography and eloquence, and I love anything that has to do with art or creativity.🎨 I like to get involved in projects that are close to my heart. <br>For example, I am currently the president of the TEDxIESEG Paris association. This association allows us to organise every year a conference under the licence of the TED organisation!!🚀</p>

				<h2>My passion for pictures and videos</h2>
				<p>I am passionate about pictures/videos and how can we capture elements of the life. For me it is important to realise how beautiful nature is and how we can capture that beauty. 4 years ago, I created an account entirely dedicated to my photographs : Pictlie</p>

				<h2>Basketball</h2>
				<p>At the same time, I also like sports a lot! <br>For more than 5 years I practised Krav Maga: a self-defence sport.🥊 <br>I also did several years of basketball! During my first year at IESEG, I was in the women's basketball team.🏀 Now I still play basketball but with my friends to relax.</p>

				<h2>Fashion</h2>
				<p>I also love fashion. Since I was a little girl, I've been drawing models of couture outfits, I'm inspired by what the couturiers do.✏️<br> I also love to learn about the history of the different Maison de couture. Last year, I did my sales internship at Chanel and I was able to be at the heart of this universe!👗👠</p>
